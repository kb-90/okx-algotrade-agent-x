# the active config parameters will be automatically generated and saved here over the current file contents once the strategy has successfully completed a full training run.
# you can find all this info in the README.md file, so don't stress!
# python -m agent_x train
# OR
# python -m agent_x.cli train
# after training, I recommend letting the strategy run in demo mode before trading with real currency
# begin demo trading with:
# python -m agent_x live (BUT MAKE SURE THAT DEMO MODE IS SET TO TRUE! Set in config.py)
